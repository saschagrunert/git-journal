## TL;DR
[tldr]: #tldr

Maintaining changelogs can be time-consuming, especially when multiple persons work on the same project. If you maintain
a separate file, merge conflicts and additional release work is sure to follow.

Sometimes complete entries are lost during merge conflict resolution, people forget to mention something or links
between issues and actual commits are missing.

It would be great, if we could use the commit history of [git](https://git-scm.com/) to generate a *beautiful* changelog
without any additional work needed.

**This is where git-journal jumps in.**

To ensure this auto-generation a framework to write more sensible commit messages is needed. Single commit messages
should contain one logical change of the project which is described in a standardized way. This results in a much
cleaner git history and provides contributors more information about the actual change.

The theoretical base consists of two RFCs:

* [RFC0001 for the commit message syntax extension](https://github.com/saschagrunert/git-journal/blob/master/rfc/0001-commit-msg.md)
* [RFC0002 for the output templating engine](https://github.com/saschagrunert/git-journal/blob/master/rfc/0002-output-templating.md)

## Installation
[installation]: #installation

To use _git-journal_ as a git extension a [Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/downloads.html) is needed
including the package manager [cargo](https://crates.io/install). Different package managers will provide these as well,
for example via [Pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.de/title/pacman) on Arch Linux:

```terminal
sudo pacman -S rust cargo
```

For a super easy installation it is also possible to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Once these two dependencies are installed, _git-journal_ can be installed via:

```terminal
cargo install git-journal
```

After adapting your `$PATH` variable to search also within `~/.cargo/bin` it should be possible to run it by invoking
`git journal`.

## Usage
[usage]: #usage

The binary `git-journal` depends on the Rust library `gitjournal`, which also can be used independently from the binary
application to write customized solutions. [This repository](https://github.com/saschagrunert/test) will be used as an
example for the following explanations.

### Default output
[defaultoutput]: #defaultoutput

If you run `git journal` anywhere inside this repository, the output will be a nice looking
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) formatted changelog based on your repositories git log:

```terminal
> git journal
[git-journal] [INFO] Skipping commit: Summary parsing: 'Merge branch 'test_branch''
[git-journal] [OKAY] Parsing done.

# Unreleased (2016-09-18):
- [Added] file4 again
    This paragraph explains the change in detail
    - [Fixed] multiple issues
    - [Removed] not needed things
- [Removed] file4.txt
- [Added] file4.txt
- [Added] file1.txt again
- [Removed] file1.txt

Fixes:
#1, #2

# v2 (2016-09-12):
- [Added] file3.txt

```

All commits are sorted by time, which means that the newest elements occur at the top. The parsing of the commit message
will be done regarding [RFC0001](https://github.com/saschagrunert/git-journal/blob/master/rfc/0001-commit-msg.md), which
describes the different syntax elements within a commit message. Categories (`[Added]`, `[Fixed]`, ...) are
automatically wrapped in square brackets if available. It is also possible to define own categories within the
configuration file. The journal automatically lists the log from the last release and the unreleased entries.

The footers of the commit messages (described in RFC0001) are automatically accumulated and printed after the changelog
list ordered by their values. It is also possible to skip the unreleased entries:

```terminal
> git journal -u
[git-journal] [OKAY] Parsing done.

# v2 (2016-09-12):
- [Added] file3.txt
```

Using a specific commit range in the format `REV..REV` or a different starting point than `HEAD` for parsing can also
be done:

```terminal
> git journal v1
> git journal v2
> git journal v1..HEAD^
```

It is also possible to print all releases (git tags) with `-a`, the past `n` releases via `-n <COUNT>`:

```terminal
> git journal -a
[git-journal] [INFO] Skipping commit: Summary parsing: 'Merge branch 'test_branch''
[git-journal] [OKAY] Parsing done.

# Unreleased (2016-09-18):
- [Added] file4 again
    This paragraph explains the change in detail
    - [Fixed] multiple issues
    - [Removed] not needed things
- [Removed] file4.txt
- [Added] file4.txt
- [Added] file1.txt again
- [Removed] file1.txt

# v2 (2016-09-12):
- [Added] file3.txt

# v1 (2016-09-12):
- [Added] file2.txt
- [Added] file1.txt
```

```terminal
> git journal -un1
[git-journal] [OKAY] Parsing done.

# v2 (2016-09-12):
- [Added] file3.txt
```

Beside the usual detailed log a short version (`-s`) exists, which just uses the commit summary:

```terminal
> git journal -as
[git-journal] [INFO] Skipping commit: Summary parsing: 'Merge branch 'test_branch''
[git-journal] [OKAY] Parsing done.

# Unreleased (2016-09-18):
- [Added] file4 again
- [Removed] file4.txt
- [Added] file4.txt
- [Added] file1.txt again
- [Removed] file1.txt

# v2 (2016-09-12):
- [Added] file3.txt

# v1 (2016-09-12):
- [Added] file2.txt
- [Added] file1.txt
```

It also possible to append the output of the journal to a file (`-o`), which will be separated by a newline (`---`) for
each git journal invocation. Git tags with a specific patterns like `rc` will be excluded automatically, which can be
customized via `-e`.

For more information please refer to the help `git journal -h`.

### Template output
[templateoutput]: #templateoutput

The design of commit message templates is described in
[RFC0002](https://github.com/saschagrunert/git-journal/blob/master/rfc/0002-output-templating.md). From now on we are
using this template for the test repository:

```toml
[[tag]]
tag = "default"
name = "Default"

[[tag]]
tag = "tag1"
name = "Section 1"

[[tag]]
[[tag.subtag]]
tag = "tag2"
name = "Subsection 1"
footers = ["Fixes"]
```

To use such a template just use the `-t` option:

```terminal
> git journal -t CHANGELOG.toml
[git-journal] [INFO] Skipping commit: Summary parsing: 'Merge branch 'test_branch''
[git-journal] [OKAY] Parsing done.

# Unreleased (2016-09-21):
## Default
- [Removed] file3.txt
- [Removed] file4.txt
- [Removed] file5.txt
- [Added] new .gitjournal
- [Improved] file5.txt
- [Fixed] this
- [Removed] that
- [Added] .gitjournal.toml file
- [Removed] not needed things
- [Removed] file4.txt
- [Added] file4.txt
- [Added] file1.txt again
- [Removed] file1.txt

## Section 1
- [Added] file4 again
- This paragraph explains the change in detail

### Subsection 1
- [Fixed] multiple issues

Fixes:
#1, #2, #1, #2, #3, #5, #6, #7

# v2 (2016-09-12):
## Default
- [Added] file3.txt
```

Everything which is untagged will go into the `default` section. The name of `tag1` will be mapped to `Section 1` and
`tag2` is a subtag of `tag1` (see the markdown header). This also means that it is now possible that list items are
uncategorized since the templating engine gives the possibility to split commits into multiple pieces. Parsed paragraphs
are converted to single list items to always provide a clean markdown. The footers are specified as an toml array of
strings which will output the selected footer keys at the correct position of the log. Please consider that the
accumulation of the footers are related to the complete tag, not just the section where there printed. Other command
line options like in the default output are available as well.

It is also possible to add a custom header or footer text to every output or every tag. For more information please read
[RFC0002](https://github.com/saschagrunert/git-journal/blob/master/rfc/0002-output-templating.md).

### Commit message preparation and verification
[prepverify]: #prepverify

To use the automatic commit message preparation and verification the git journal setup has to be executed on every local
repository:

```terminal
> git journal setup
[git-journal] [OKAY] Defaults written to '.gitjournal.toml' file.
[git-journal] [OKAY] Git hook installed to '.git/hooks/commit-msg'.
[git-journal] [OKAY] Git hook installed to '.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg'.
[git-journal] [OKAY] Installed bash completions to the path.
[git-journal] [OKAY] Installed fish completions to the path.
[git-journal] [OKAY] Installed zsh completions to the path.
```

If there already exists these hooks _git-journal_ tries to append the needed commands, which has to be verified by hand
afterwards. The generated command line completions for bash and fish needs to be put in the correct directory of your
shell. The default configuration file is a [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file which represents
[this structure](https://saschagrunert.github.io/git-journal/gitjournal/config/struct.Config.html). A default
configuration with comments can also be
[found here](https://saschagrunert.github.io/git-journal/gitjournal/struct.GitJournal.html#examples-1).

If the setup is done _git-journal_ will verify your inserted commit message as well as doing a commit message
preparation. For example, if we are now trying to commit something which can not be parsed:

```terminal
> touch my_file
> git add my_file
> git commit -m "This commit contains no cactegory"
[git-journal] [ERROR] Commit message preparation failed: GitJournal: Parser: Summary parsing: 'This commit contains no cactegory'
```

Since we are using the `-m` flag there is no chance for the user to edit the message any more and _git-journal_ will
reject it. If we are using a commit message editor via the usual `git commit` without the `-m` we will get a default
commit message template:

```terminal
JIRA-1234 Added ...

# Add a more detailed description if needed

# - Added ...
# - Changed ...
# - Fixed ...
# - Improved ...
# - Removed ...
```

The `JIRA-1234` prefix is just the default and can be configured via the `.gitjournal.toml` file. If the submitted
commit message is also invalid we will get an error like this:

```terminal
[git-journal] [ERROR] Commit message invalid: GitJournal: Parser: Summary parsing: 'This commit message is also invalid'
```

If everything went fine it should look like this:
```terminal
> git commit -m "Added my_file"
[git-journal] [OKAY] Commit message prepared.
[git-journal] [OKAY] Commit message valid.
[master 1b1fcad] Added my_file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 my_file
```

If a default template is configured then _git-journal_ will also check the available tags of the template against your
commit message tags. So there will be an error if one of the tags within the commit message is not available within the
defined template:

```terminal
[git-journal] [WARN] These tags are not part of the default template: 'tag1'.
[git-journal] [ERROR] Commit message invalid: GitJournal: Verify: Not all tags exists in the default template.
```
This means in detail that _git-journal_ will build up two gates (one for preparation and one for verification) during
doing the commit by the user. This graphic will sum up where _git-journal_ will take influence on the local git
repository:
